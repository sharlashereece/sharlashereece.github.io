					<p> I’m not the best at articulating myself, but I thought it was important to try because I cannot be the only person who experiences this:</p>	
					<p>
I have always been known as the “smart” girl. The one who magically understands everything and does amazingly well. I received 6A* and 5A at GCSE and A*AA at A Level and a First Class in my first year at University. I’m not saying this to gloat. It is purely for contextual reasons. </p>
<p>
Obviously, doing well doesn’t come easy. I go through the same stresses as everyone else, but I have lost the courage to even talk about it anymore because all I get back is “Don’t worry. You’ll be fine. You always are”. I know people mean well, but I constantly feel like my worries are ignored or determined as trivial by my peers because of my track record relative to my peers.

	<p>I really hate this statement for three reasons:</p>
		<p class="bullet-point">1.	It always comes across to me as malicious or envious. I’m not sure if this is intended, but its like people don’t understand why I’m complaining because I’ve never done badly before. The statement makes me feel like they think I’m complaining for no reason</p>	
		<p class="bullet-point">
2.	What if I’m not fine? You have now shut me down and deemed my panicking as silly. You haven’t calmed me down or reassured me at all. In fact, you’ve implanted a burden in me that I have to maintain this perfect score because it’s expected that I always will, and now you’ve made me feel like I can’t even turn to you when I’m in trouble.</p>
<p class="bullet-point">
3.	If you say I’m going to be fine, why should I bother? It’s all going to magically work out in my favour isn’t it? I know this is contradictory to my previous statement, but it requires a LOT of self-motivation to continue studying when you’re alone, and everyone around you tells you you’re going to do fine anyways. I’m constantly fighting an internal battle because I know I need to study, but everyone assumes this comes easy to me, so I believe them and I skip lectures and leave things to the last minute. Only when deadlines are nearing, I realise that I do in fact have to work to maintain these grades and I get my shit together

</p>

<p>I know I cannot be the only person with these conflicting emotions regarding the maintenance of academic attainment, and it doesn’t help being the first in my family to go to university, Not only are my friends diminishing  my worries, but my family don’t necessarily have the skills to help me. </p>

<p>I don’t really expect anything to come from this other than the acknowledgement that we “smart” people are not perfect, and we need someone to rant to too. Rather than tell us we will do fine, help us plan how to be fine. Sometimes we just need to talk through a plan of action, or sit with someone whilst we study so we truly know we are not alone. </p>
